# Upload_file_using_Flask
Task-1:
Create a form in the frontend where the user will upload the provided csv file (data.csv).
After the csv is uploaded, the contents of the csv should be inserted into the database. You
should use the pandas library to read the uploaded csv. You have to store the following
information from the csv into the database
● image_name
● objects_detected
● timestamp

Task-2:
On the same page create 2 input date elements from which the user can select the start date
and end date. Now fetch the results between these dates and display them to the user in a
table format. The table should consist of the following information: image_name, detections,
image (use the images provided in the zip file). 

Task-3 (Bonus Points if you attempt this):
A report should be generated in the backend application which counts the total number of
objects detected between the given date range. Use the python csv module to generate the
csv. The sample output report (report.csv) will be provided to you in the zip file
